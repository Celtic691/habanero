Habanero Change Log

 Habanero v2.3.2 - 26 March 2010	 
	 
Major Changes
- Added Support for MSAccess2007 to Habanero
- Dramatically improved the performance of loading collections. 
- Add the IN operator to loading BusinessObjectCollections.
- Created a DataAccessorMultiSource, which can switch between DataAccessors based on the type loaded or saved. For this I also created a BusinessObjectLoaderMultiSource and a TransactionCommitterMultiSource. 
- Added a TransactionCommitterRemote which can be used to create a 3-tier deployment architecture where the TransactionCommitterRemote operates as a proxy for the real transaction committer on another physical machine.

Enhancements
- Added the ability to set virtual properties using the EditableDataSetProvider. (i.e editable grid can edit C# properties, not just BOProps)
- Added auto increment field support for In-Memory data store ( fixed issue #276 ).
- Added a new HabaneroAppConsoleInMemory which sets up a console app with an in-memory data store.
- Added a new parameter for the DataGridView: 'currencyFormat'. This can be used when defining a column in a UIGrid to set the format to display a double/decimal value.
- The GridControls now use the GlobalUIRegistry.DateDisplaySettings.GridDateFormat to display all dates that do not have formats defined by the "dateFormat" parameter
- Added ShowAsCompulsory Property to UIFormField Definition.  This allows you to override the properties underlying Compulsory value with a derived Value for a particular BusinessObject.

Minor Changes
- Changed BusinessObject.Save to return the BusinessObject
- Created a ClassDefValidator class that does the PostLoadChecks. Moved the tests from TestXmlClassDefsLoader. Updated the HabaneroApp classes to load and validate the classdefs using the new classdefvalidator.
- Changed the creation preference of ControlMappers via reflection to constructors with an IControlFactory argument.
- Added a ToArray method to the Utilities class.
- Updated Rhino.Mocks to the latest version.
- Added CollectionRefreshedEvent on BusinessObjectCollection
- Improved the FilterDef and FilterPropertyDef constructors.
- Added BOHelper to aid testing BO Rules linked to a BO.
- Added a Remove method to ClassDefCol that takes a className and assemblyName.
- Added a typeParameter property to ISuperClassDef, and to the loader that loads it from xml.
- Changed BusinessObjectCollection to implement IList instead of Inherit from List this is due to the strange behaviour that you get when you try to use a BusinessObjectCollection as a List and you run into issues that the incorrect Add and Remove are being used.
- Changed the ClassDefHelper.GetSuperClassClassDef to take into account the type parameter of the ISuperClassDef
- Add RemoveAll to BusinessObjectCollection
- Changed the default of 'now' and 'today' of a propdef to resolve the value on creation instead of on persistance. Moved DateTimeNow into its own class. DateTimeNow and DateTimeToday now have TypeConverter classes.
- Added a ConvertTo method to TypeUtilities.
- Added the ToArray method to BusinessObjectCollection.
- Extracted an IOrderCriteria from OrderCriteria. Moved OrderCriteria.Field to a class called OrderCriteriaField and extracted an interface called IOrderCriteriaField
- Changed the default min button size because our resolutions are getting bigger.
- Increased the visibility of some classes.
- Changed the PrimaryKeyDef property to return null if it is null (it was returning the super class' PrimaryKeyDef).  Changed the construction behaviour to use the super class' PrimaryKeyDef if its one is null.  
- Set the ShowIcon property on the _createdForm to false. This prevents the visual studio icon from appearing on the top right of forms created using the FormControlCreator.
- Added an Property to expose a DataAccessorInMemory's DataStoreInMemory.
- Removed the JpgMetaData and test class - it's a very ancillary class and shouldn't be part of core Habanero.
- Added HasSetting to the ISettings interface.
- Added PreserveSelectedItem to ComboBoxCollectionSelector.  Changed RelationshipComboBoxMapper to preserve the selected item.
- Modified IFilterControl AddBooleanFilterComboBox to use a default value.
- Removed DatabaseUtil because it is no longer needed.
- Added MoveBack and MoveOn Wizard Step Properties to cater for functionality on those actions and wrote tests for the wizard controller.
- Added a TestDataAccessorDB class, and added the ability to give a DataAccessorDB the connection you want it to use instead of it just using the CurrentConnection.
- Removed some references to DatabaseConnection.CurrentConnection, replacing them with parameters in the constructor to the object (injecting).
- Made the CollapsibleMenuVWG and related classes enumerable.  
- Added a CoverageExcludeAttribute for excluding pieces of code from test coverage stats (for untestable code eg network accessing or message boxes popping up)
- Changes to support loading of xml into domain model in FireStarter Modeller
- Changed to use IRelationshipDef and IRelKeyDef etc to support loading into the domain model using the xml loaders.

Bug Fixes
- Added Error handling with DataStoreInMemoryXmlReader which allows the business object to be loaded from an XML store when the business object has had a property removed since the data was written to.
- Fixed a bug with loading a classdef where two classes using single table inheritance with the same base class are related on one's primary key. Had to take out a check at load time because the superclass may not have been loaded yet, but there is a check in the post-load checks that validates the relationship correctly.
- Fixed bug in DataStoreInMemory where the Inherited children where not being returned when Refreshing a BusinessObjectCollection.
- Wrote tests and fixed issue with removing events on the BusinessObjectCollection that have not been added.
- Fixed a small bug in EditableDataSetProvider when a related property (eg MyOwner.CarID) did not have a MyOwner set up.  Just added a check for a null property and skipped the assignment of the value in the grid to the property.  This prevents an ugly "object reference not set" error, but it also means the object is not set. Fortunately this is picked up in the error provider so you still get notified of a problem.
- Fixed some code in BusinessObjectLoaderBase to avoid the collection was modified exception.
- Fixed errors in the DataStoreInMemoryXmlReader where loaded object were New and Dirty.
- Fixed some methods that were still not implemented for BOCol.
- Fixed MultiSelector s.t. uses IList instead of List
- Fixed Bugs in the CollectionComboBoxMapper.
- Fixed some bugs in PanelBuilder and DefaultBOEditorForm.
- Fixed the sizing of the panels produced by the PanelBuilder.
- Fixed Minor Bug in HasWarnings
- Fixed Bug in ReadOnlyGridControl Relating to setting AllowUsersToAddBO, AllowUsersToDeleteBO and AllowUsersToEditBO should hide/show relevant buttons.
- Fixed bug in Reflection Utilities when using SetPropertyValue with an interface type property.
- Fixed bug in EditableDataSetProvider with Virtual Property's default values.
- Fixed Bug where setting ReadOnlyGridControl AllowUsersToEditBO did not set DoubleClickEditsBusinessObject.
- Fixed Bug where the AllowUsersToAddBO is being set to true when the Collection is set even if it is false after.
- Fixed Grid Initialiser s.t. uses Format correctly for Virtual Props.
- Fixed ClassDef GetPropertyType s.t. it returns the Correct type for Virtual Props.
- Fixed Bug where the PropertyType for a ReflectiveProperty that is Nullable did not return the underlying Type
- Implemented custom SqlFormatter for Access so that it handles boolean values correctly.
- Fixed Minor bug in CollectionComboBoxMapper where OwningBoPropertyName of certain datatypes would not find item.
- Made the DefaultBOEditorFormVWG use the BORegistry.DataAccessor to create its ITransactionCommitter instead of using a TransactionCommitterDB.
- Fixed a minor bug with adding a null Business Object to the transaction committer


 Habanero v2.3.1 - 10 September 2009

HABANERO
MAJOR CHANGES
- Added ability to write the contents of a DataStoreInMemory to a stream using DataStoreInMemoryXmlWriter and DataStoreInMemoryXmlReader.
- Added DataStoreInMemoryBinaryWriter and DataStoreInMemoryBinaryReader to write to a binary file.
- Changed SQL Server IsolationLevel to ReadUncommitted.
- Added code to set the Related Object on Relationship when the ID is set.
- Moved files from the Util project into base. Removed the Util project.
  Note: Any systems that use ByteString or LongText (these are custom property types supplied by Habanero) will need to change those properties to use the new assembly and namespace.
   i.e.: The line:
    <property name=""TestProp"" type=""LongText"" assembly=""Habanero.Util"" />
   Should now read:
    <property name=""TestProp"" type=""Habanero.Util.LongText"" assembly=""Habanero.Base"" />
   And the line:
    <property name=""TestProp"" type=""ByteString"" assembly=""Habanero.Util"" />
   Should now read:
    <property name=""TestProp"" type=""Habanero.Util.ByteString"" assembly=""Habanero.Base"" />
- Added some visual tests to Column and Grid Layout Managers.
- Improved layout manager performance by using SuspendLayout and ResumeLayout.
- Removed all trace of FormGrids. These are replaced by the a new feature in forms that allows you to put a groupbox down and put whatever control you want inside it (such as a grid, with its mapper).

MINOR CHANGES

- Created CrossThreadRunner in Habanero.Base(Util) for tests that require execution on the STA Thread.
- Changed RethrowingExceptionNotifier to throw the original error.
- Restructured the tests - moved tests from Habanero.Test.General to other places where they belonged more. Analysed the tests in general and deleted some that were duplicating tests done elsewhere.

- Parametrised the ParameterNameGenerator constructor (with the prefixchar) and wrote a CreateParameterNameGenerator method for each DatabaseConnection type.
- Extracted IConnectionStringFactory and IDatabaseConnectionFactory interfaces.
DOMAIN MODEL
- Created an xsd file to validate ClassDefs xml. Created a class to validate a classdefs xml against this schema.
- Added TimeOut feature to the BusinessObjectLookupList.
- Modified XmlLoader to allow a Discriminator on ClassTableInheritance, but this is still not supported in the BO.
- Converted all ClassDef classes to implement interfaces which now exist in Habanero.Base.
- Changed IDefClassFactory to return ClassDef objects by their interfaces so that it can be overridden with other implementing objects.
- Added a BusinessObject property to the IBOProp interface.
- Got rid of parameterless constructor on XmlLoader so that the IDefClassFactory always has to be set so that it can be injected.
- Changed the Xml loading tests to allow for overriding the IDefClassFactory instantiation.
UI
- Added support for multiple levels of relationship mapping in the UI mappers (Created BORelationshipMapper and BOPropertyMapper).
- Made ControlFactoryWin members virtual (so that they can be overridden)
- Modified MultiSelector/IMultiSelector by adding access to the GroupBox around the AvailableOptionsListBox and SelectedOptionsListBox.
- Added better error handling to ReadOnlyGridControls.

- Created a StaticTextFilter for permanent filter criteria.
- Centred DefaultBOEditorForm on the screen by default.
- Renamed a couple of the DateRangeComboBox options to clear ambiguity - had reports from users about it not working correctly because he interpreted "This Month" to include all dates until the end of the month. Have renamed "This Month" to "Month to Date". Same for "This Year" and "This Week".

BUG FIXES
